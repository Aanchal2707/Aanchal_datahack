# Aanchal_datahack
Overview :
This project involves training a machine learning model to predict two target variables: xyz_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine. The model utilizes features from a dataset, preprocesses the data, trains a model using a RandomForestClassifier within a MultiOutputClassifier, evaluates its performance, and generates predictions for a test set. The results are saved in a CSV file for submission.
 
 
Python libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn

The datasets used in this project include:
training_set_features.csv - Features for the training set.
training_set_labels.csv - Labels for the training set.
test_set_features.csv - Features for the test set.
submission_format.csv - Format for the submission file.
